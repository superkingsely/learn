To make your laptop faster in 2026, you can apply several software optimizations and, if the hardware allows, perform physical upgrades. Modern operating systems like Windows 11 have specific features—such as "Efficiency Mode"—designed to manage background resources more effectively. 

1. Immediate Software Optimizations

Manage Startup Apps: Many programs launch automatically, hogging RAM and CPU from the moment you boot.
Windows: Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc), go to the Startup apps tab, and disable non-essential programs.
Mac: Go to System Settings > General > Login Items and remove unnecessary apps.

Enable High Performance Mode: Change your power plan to prioritize speed over battery life. In Windows 11, go to Settings > System > Power & battery and set the Power mode to Best performance.

Use Efficiency Mode: In Windows 11, you can use Task Manager to put specific background processes into Efficiency Mode, which lowers their priority to free up resources for your active work.
Disable Visual Effects: Fancy animations and transparency consume GPU and CPU power.

Search for "Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows" and select Adjust for best performance.

Turn off Transparency effects under Settings > Personalization > Colors. 

2. System Maintenance & Cleanup
Disk Cleanup: Use built-in tools like Storage Sense (Windows) or Storage Management (Mac) to delete temporary files, system caches, and junk.
Uninstall Bloatware: Remove pre-installed apps or software you no longer use to free up disk space and reduce background activity.
Check for Malware: Malicious software often runs in the background, stealing resources. Run a full scan using Windows Security or a reputable third-party tool.
Update Drivers: Outdated drivers, especially for graphics and chipsets, can cause significant slowdowns. Use Windows Update or your manufacturer’s utility (like Dell SupportAssist) to get the latest versions. 
3. Hardware Upgrades (The Most Impactful)
If your laptop is still slow after software fixes, hardware upgrades offer the most significant boost: 
Upgrade to an SSD: If you are still using a traditional Hard Disk Drive (HDD), replacing it with an SSD (Solid State Drive) is the single best upgrade you can make. It can be up to 6x faster for daily tasks.
Add More RAM: For modern multitasking and development in 2026, 16GB of RAM is considered the safer choice, while 32GB is ideal for heavy workloads like Docker or virtual machines.
Physical Cleaning: Dust buildup in fans and vents causes overheating, which leads to "thermal throttling"—where the system intentionally slows down to prevent damage. Use compressed air to clear vents regularly.
